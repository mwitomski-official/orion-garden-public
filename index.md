# ðŸŒ± Digital Fortress

## What is this place?

> _"If you can't explain it simply,Â **you don't understand it well enough**"_

The site is building according to the concept of a [Digital Garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden).

ðŸŒ± About Digital Garden

> The phrase "_digital garden_" is a metaphor for thinking about **writing** and **creating** that focuses less on the resulting "_showpiece_" and more on the **process**, **care**, and **craft** it takes to get there. A garden is usually a place where **things grow**.
