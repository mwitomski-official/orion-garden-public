## Description

This is the system proposed by [[Tiago Forte]].

The key to Inbox Zero, everyone knows, is to **touch each email only once.** **it takes far, FAR less time and energy to maintain your email inbox at zero than at a thousand**.

## Actions

### The obvious stuff

- **Unsubscribe** from every newsletter, notification list, and broadcast list that isn’t absolutely essential,
- **Forward** all your email accounts to Gmail, or whatever service you have to use for work.

### Strip email down to its core function

Let’s turn back the tide and strip email down to its original function, the only one that it does better than any other tool: **collecting new inputs.**

1. **Turn off** multiple inboxes (contradiction with Jeff Su),
2. **Turn off** all **“smart” features** - Every single one of these features is a maladaptive add-on to an outdated system; a short-term solution to a long-term problem,
3. **Turn off** all chat and social media apps,
4. **Turn off** all notifications - Also **turn off** all notifications in _your computer’s operating system_, on _your phone_, and any _other devices_.

> [!tip]+ Inbox configuration (Gmail)

> **Multiple inboxes**
>
> - *Settings* > **Inbox** > set *Inbox type:* to *Default* > uncheck all *Categories:* except for *Primary*
>
> **All “smart” features**

> - **Stars:**
>   - *Settings* > **_General_** > set *Presets:* to *1 star* (which you’re not going to use),
> - **Personal level indicators:**
>   - *Settings* > **_General_** > set *Personal level indicators* to *No indicators*,
> - **System labels:**
>   - *Settings* > **_Labels_** > hide all system labels except for *Sent* *Mail*, *Drafts*, *All Mail*, and (if you want) *Spam*,
> - **Categories:**
>   - *Settings* > **_Labels_** > hide all categories in label list and message list,
> - **Labels:**
>   - *Settings* > **_Labels_** > delete all labels at the bottom,
> - **Importance markers:**
>   - *Settings* > **_Inbox_** > set *Importance markers* to *No markers*,
> - **Filters:**
>   - *Settings* > **_Filters and Blocked Addresses_** > delete all filters
>
> **Chat and social media apps**
>
> - *Settings* > **_Chat_** > set *Chat* to *Chat off*
>
> **Notifications**
>
> - *Settings* > **_General_** > set *Desktop Notifications* to *Mail notifications off*

### Set up four downstream systems

Follow the sequence:

1. Open **Gmail**
2. Open **the oldest email** in your inbox
3. Decide what needs to be done about it, and **take one** of the **6 following actions**:
   ![IZW_Diagram|800](stuff/files/InboxZeroWorkFlow/IZW_Diagram.webp)
4. **Operation:** Archive
   - **Gmail shortcut:** <span class="text-marker">e</span>
5. **Operation:** Reply
   - **Gmail shortcut:** <span class="text-marker">r</span>
   - **Next (path #1):** you can **archive** email message,
   - **Next (path #2):** or you can create reminder (**#4** point below) and you need to follow up and then archive.
6. **Operation:** Add to calendar - **Gmail shortcut:** ❌ (calendar event must be created manually if needed), - **Next:** Archive email message.
   > [!note]+ Note
   >
   > You can paste the link to the email in the calendar entry if needed, but this is unnecessary with Google invites, and a quick search will turn up the original email if needed anyway.
7. **Operation:** Create task - **Gmail shortcut:** <span class="text-marker">Shift + t</span>, - **Next:** Archive email message.
   > [!note]+ Note
   >
   > Hit the keyboard shortcut for the task manager you’re using, **write out the task associated with the message (with a link back to this email generated automatically)**, and **then archive the email**.
8. **Operation:** Read Later
   - **Gmail shortcut:** ❌ (yellow button _Keep_ right side menu -> _Take a note_ -> if you selected mail then this mail will be added to note),
   - **Next:** Archive email message.
9. **Operation:** Send to Reference app (in my scope it will be: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/))
   If operation **4** or **5** need to be developed then it will be added to Obsidian application as document with elaboration. Generally an option used for email subscriptions.
