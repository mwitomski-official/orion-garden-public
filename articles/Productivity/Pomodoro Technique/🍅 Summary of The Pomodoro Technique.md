## Rules
1. 🔥 A **[[Pomodoro]]** consists of **25 minutes** + 5 minute break,
2. 🔥 After every 4 **Pomodoros** (2h [l1]) comes a **15-30 minute break**,
3. 🔥 The **Pomodoro** is **indivisible**. 
	1.  ❌ There are no **half** or **quarter** **Pomodoros** 
4. 🔥 If a **Pomodoro**[l2] begins, It has to ring: 
	1. ❗ If a Pomodoro is **interrupted definitively** – i.e. the interruption isn’t handled – it’s considered void, never begun, and it can’t be recorded with an **X**. 
	2. ❗ If an activity is **completed once** a **Pomodoro** has already begun, continue reviewing the same activity until the Pomodoro rings. 
5. 🔥 Protect the **Pomodoro**. 
	1. Inform *effectively*, *negotiate quickly* to *reschedule the interruption*, call back the person who interrupted you as agreed. 
6. 🔥 If It lasts more than **5-7 Pomodoros**, Break it down. 
	1. ➡ **Complex activities should be divided into several activities**.
7. 🔥 If It lasts less than one **Pomodoro**, Add It Up. 
	1. ➡ Simple tasks can be combined.
8. 🔥 Results are achieved **Pomodoro** after Pomodoro. 
9. 🔥 The Next **Pomodoro** *Will Go Better*.

### Legend
* [l1] I assume that it looks like: $$P = (S + B) * 4p$$
$$P = (25 min + 5 min) * 4p = 120 min / 60 min = 2 h$$
* [l2] **[[Pomodoro]]** in our context.

	 ➡ Kitchen timer used to measure 25-minute intervals. The name of the Technique comes from the first timer used which was shaped like a tomato (pomodoro in Italian).
